# Project-Blockchain coding tutorial & Machu Picchu White Paper
*(version January 2023)*

Are you interested in blockchain programming, but hesitate to start, not being a programmer? or maybe you are IT project manager or higher IT executive? I was like you in 2016 and this post is what I wished have existed. You are reading a Full-Stack tutorial, showing how to code a smart contract in Solidity, deploy it on a testnet, code a JavaScript frontend with React, deploy it for a public access.

- *What makes this tutorial different from the others is that it implements a real-life application, a humanitarian assistance project Machu Picchu. As such, this humanitarian initiative is described in depth.*

##	Reading guide
This tutorial can also be read in a reverse way, as a white paper of a humanitarian assistance project, showing hands-on how current state-of-the-art technology can help change significatively the efficiency of humanitarian actions.
- After reading the white paper, if you —as a humanitarian executive— are convinced that this approach may help ease existing pains, you can follow the tutorial part, learning how to implement it for real. No prerequisite in programming.

Finally, this document can serve as input for hackathon teams, as a guide and some prototype components, for them to hack advanced tools to a purposeful result and win.
